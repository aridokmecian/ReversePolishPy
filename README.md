####How to Use and examples of Polish Notation
```
To write a simple equation in Polish Notation you must write both coefficient's followed by the operator

For example: 
1 + 2 -> 1 2 +
2 - 3 -> 2 3 -
3 * 4 -> 3 4 *
5 / 6 -> 5 6 /

we are not limited to single operator equations either 
For example:
(1 + 2) * ((3 / 4) - (5 / 6)) -> 1 2 + 3 4 / 5 6 / - *
